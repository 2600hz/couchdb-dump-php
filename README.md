CouchDB Dump/Restore Tools
==========================

PHP scripts to dump and restore CouchDB databases.


Reason, why I written them
--------------------------

Because I found no usable and available tools to dump Couch databases, including history revisions, if needed.


Why on PHP?
-----------

Why not? This is just scripting language. I know it. If you would like, you can write your one scripts, for example on Python, with all bells and whistles, with blackjack and hookers.


Usage
-----

Just run each script with -h flag and read help.
